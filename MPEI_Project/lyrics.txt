0,ego-remix,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano"
1,then-tell-me,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"playin' everything so easy,
it's like you seem so sure.
still your ways, you dont see
i'm not sure if they're for me.
then things come right along our way, though we didn't truly ask.
it seems as if they're gonna linger
with every delight they bring,
just like what you have truly seemed.
i'm trying to think of what you really want to say,
even through my darkest day.
you might want to leave me,
feeling strange about you
like you're gonna let me know,
when words then slipped out of you.
when words dont come so easy to say
you just leave me feeling, come what may
though i want things coming from your way.
i say to you, you bore me all the time
when you seem to hold back all in you,
all that you want to let me know.
why dont you have the courage?
speak up and i'll listen,
if you truly want me to know, then tell me.
is there something wrong with you
and you seem fastened there.
it sounds as if there'll be a melody
if things in you are let out
and then i will feel alright.
when you sleep, do you feel the same,
exactly as i do?
i really want to hear things from you,
though i've felt something new
eversince you acted that way.
if i go,
would you still mind telling me?
if i stay,
you seem to let the days go by.
if you truly want to let me know,
then tell me."
2,honesty,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give
Chorus:
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you
I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize
If I wear my heart
Out on my sleeve
But I don't want
Some pretty face
To tell me
Pretty lies
All I want
Is someone
To believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep
Inside of me
Don't be
Too concerned
I won't ask
For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want
Sincerity
Tell me where else
Can I turn
When
You're the one
That I depend upon
(Chorus)"

[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be ""Life with Superman""
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say

Oh oh oh I
[Verse 2:]
If I were to try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'd run out of fingers
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum,
I'm talking everything
More than a single wish,
I'm talking every dream

Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you
[Bridge:]
If there's options I don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine
You're a rock in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right

5,all-i-could-do-was-cry,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"I heard
Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry"

Waitin' for the right one.

Hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore

Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Tell me that your living in a place
Where no one else can find you.
Tell me that your sanging out my name,
Hoping that I'll hear you.
Tell me ""No"" and I'll fade away,
But this is lovin that I won't waste
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)

How do I know if I'll ever love again

That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch 22
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down

Welcome
Welcome
Hey
Ohhhh
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face
Just to get it done.
Welcome to the human race
Where if you ain't got money, then you'll pay in pain
Welcome to this world of ours
And if you had the chance would you come back again ?
Cause now you're here there ain't no turning back,
You got tears in your eyes
And the monkey on your back (?)*
Akhenaton - Verse 1:
Bienvenue l o l'fort tue le faible, o la faim tue de fait
O la socit t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite,
O les dettes cumulent, o l'crdit accule, des tas d'foyers,
O les hommes en perte d'idaux, jurent qu'par les putes dvoyes en vido,
Chaque soir c'est la fte, les salons cossus attirent les fesses,
Sur les gros cads, qui arrosent les guridons de pure cocane,
Ici, les gosses rvent d't'Pirs, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent,
Nombreux sont ceux qui ds 13 ans connaissent leur premire ivresse,
Bienvenue l o l'air pollu, par les pots d'chappement dclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches,
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Tolune,
Les vices connus gnent la machine de l'Etat, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en tat, peu passent les menottes en mtal, on en est l
Ici 300 blinds font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramnent tout leur p'tite gueule, quand mille meurent fauchs dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, aprs le 11 septembre on voque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde haute voix
O les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les m'mes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre part ces connards en taule
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fant'mes, un hymne sanguinaire
On entonne, partout on sent la peur d'un peuple pass au pantone
L'hiver mange l't, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne,
Crie Plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont gar quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde

Shurik'n - Verse 2:
Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tant't l'un tant't l'autre.
Ange et dmon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent.
O l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement quand elle frappe nos portes.
O la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup de surin dans l'aorte.
O tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on te le dit qu'20 ans aprs.
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils le diront jamais.
O on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon bien avant qu'il meure
Puis on se vante de le connatre achetant ses tableaux visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde o on se dit tous gaux blague part l
L'caniveau l haut c'est les bureaux mais le mieux c'est au milieu
O on se sait si fragile qu'on prvoit les pices d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achtera des jambes en famille le dimanche
O tout le monde ne mange pas sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Crer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne ses fins
La misre comme moyen o le suppos mort esclavage svit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois ! Il y a toujours des grains de poussire vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas Gattaca mais presque o seul l'lu vite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse se manifeste,
O on parle prslection, d'amlioration, transformation
Gntique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de super soldats de plomb
O on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
O on entend le mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envole la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'prfrerais qu'tu le dcouvre,
Allez petit ! Lance toi t'inquite fonce ! Moi, j'te couvre

Talked about, out my friends mouths
I've been beat down til He turned my life around
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me

Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me

If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything

The taste sensation he loves so well,
Now is gone, and he starts to yell.
His Pepsi fell, he shows his lust (the joy of life)
The joy of life he needs it anyhow (the joy of life, the joy of taste)
He makes the sound of a tender bear (the joy of Pepsi)

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
""You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man""
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Oh,
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own..
You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago
Oh I'm screaming out, for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen...
[Chorus]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't....
If you won't....
LISTEN!!!...
To the song here in my heart
A melody I've started
But I will complete
Oh,
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own..
My own..."

When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend

I still remember, I called you cryin'
'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, ""Beyonce, I told ya so""
Instead you said you'd get one too

And I need to live my life because my time is unforgivable
I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown on the grown?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Leaving in the car and much be spent on television
Oh girlfriend, get your mind on right
Don't spend your time 'cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last but you must feed the mind
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind

Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals
Before she reaches the light
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got
And other times it makes you pay
Well, when you finally rise
Then you'll realize
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes
Oh you could wish on the stars but they dead, just a lie
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

'cause he's gonna hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps
Always running the streets
He's playing the game
And he'll never love me
You say that he's fake
But why does it feel so real
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I'ma always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
(The love that we share it lives inside of me)
No matter what you hear-ing, its all in the past
No matter what you feel-ing his love is gon last
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)
[Chorus]
He's my man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
My man
(With him I'm so comfotable)
My man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
He's thuged out but he's my man
[Verse]
You say you don't trust him
Be'cause he's been locked up
You say he in trouble
'cause he out in a strip club
But you were young once
So you should understand
You say that you know
Say you've been a witness
You say it's for sure
Say he got a mistress
Until you can show me
I'm gon stand by him
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I'ma always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
(The love that we share it lives inside of me)
No matter what you hear-ing, its all in the past
No matter what you feel-ing his love is gon last
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)

Every single morning I try to pray!
Grandmama nem they never forgot, nothing else really means nothing to me.
I ain't stunting to be.
Talking to me?
Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on, there

Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander

can't help but wander: how come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring

I'd roll out of bed in the morning

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls

And I'd never get confronted for it

How it feels to love a girl

When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home...

How it feels to love a girl

Until you lose the one you wanted

You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top
If you're going through it just know it's called ""going through it""
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive"

[Verse 1: BeyoncÃ©]
It's that YoncÃ©, your YoncÃ©
In that lingerie, on that chardonnay
Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B
And I'm Rambo-ing these hoes
I'm really rit like Donjae
I'm camo-ing these hoes
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no
We escalating, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn
[Bridge 1: BeyoncÃ©]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)
[Hook: BeyoncÃ©]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless

Say ""I look so good tonight""

Say ""I look so good tonight""

[Bridge 2: BeyoncÃ©]
I wake up looking this good
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I could, if I, if I, could)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit
(What you want I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
(I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
I want everyone to feel like this tonight

250,8-ball-remix,2007,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Verse 1:
I don't drink brass monkey, like to be funky
Nickname Eazy-E your 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kickin', to show my shit
Rap a hole in my dick, boy I don't quit
Crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way
I got a six shooter yo mean hombre
Rolling through the hood to find the boys kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers, I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and it's freezing my balls
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself, They can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the east side south of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face, and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
Verse 2:
Riding on Slauson down towards Crenshaw
Turned down south, to dish the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit,
Cos a mexican almost wrecked my shit.
Flipped his ass off, put it to the floor,
Bottle was empty so I went to the store.
Nigga on till cos I was drunk,
See ya sissy as punk had to go in my trunk.
Reached inside cos it's like that,
Came back out with a silver Gat.
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was.
Verse 3:
Put up the jam and, like a mirage,
A sissy like that got out of Dodge.
Sucker on me, cos the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin'
Old E's 800 cos that's my plan.
Take it in a bottle, 40, quart, or can.
Drink it like a madman, yes I do,
Fuck the police, and a 5-0 too.
Stepped at a party I was drunk as hell,
Three bitches already said ""Eric yo breath smells""
40-ounce in hand, that's what I got,
""Yo man, you see Eazy hurlin' in the parkin' lot?""
Stepped on yo foot, cold dissed yo ho,
Asked her to dance and she said ""Hell, no""
Called her a bitch, cos that's the rule,
Boys in the hood tryin to keep me cool.
Tell me, homeboy, you wanna kick my butt?
I walked in your face and we get em up.
I start drivin the dog, and watch you fold,
Just dumb, full of cum, got num dot co.
""Make you look sick, ya snotty-nose prick,
Now your fly bitch is all over his dick.""
Punk got dropped, cos the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin'.
Verse 4:
Pass the broom, motherfucker, while I tear shit up,
And y'all listen up close to roll-call.
Eazy-E's in the place, I got money and juice,
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce.
Dre makes the beat so god-damn funky,
Do the 0-8, fuck the brass monkey.
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say,
Hail to the niggas from CIA.
Crazy D is down and in effect,
We make hardcore jams, so fuck respect.
Make a toast, pumpy pump to the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin."

And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

Song: Pass Me Da Green
Typed by: burn1ing@aol.com
This is a ghetto public announcement (weed smokers)
Roll your blunts tight
And light your joints
Inhale...slowly exhale
And that's how you get high.
(clip from Friday)
I know you don't smoke weed... I know this
But I'm gonna get you high today
Cause it's Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got shit to do
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 8X*}
(Inhale....exhale) Eyes selling red, got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoke some green with her mama
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store
Picked up some blunts, got ten on the 2-0
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Got a nigga's head spinning like the seven seas
Puff, puff, pass, nigga that's what Simon say
Fools that hog the green or da weed gonna get carried away
Fingernails burnt, lookin like a tweeker
Ears steadily poppin, but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry, fiendin for them munchies
cause real smokers don't blow no fuckin green on empty stomachs
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 4X*}
Green trees pack wood, make cabbage
I like to get high but it ain't a bad habit
Speed up with that weed smoke comin out my 'llac
Got a hottie in the front and one in the back
Blowin shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin lac at Holiday Inn
I ain't even trippin, told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady cause she know I'm ready
Choppin up weed like motherfuckin spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
cause every time I hit the weed I'm lookin for Isuzus
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 5X*}
Y'all high yet?
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 3X*}
Damn nigga y'all chokin, get the fuck out of here nigga
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy
Nigga I said are y'all high yet?
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 3X*}

You thinkin you hearing voices nigga?

(AMG)
I refuse to lose so I chose few and trust none
To my women I love, but to you bitches I aint the one
When i tell you to trust no bitch, It might not occur to you
females aint the only bitches that Im refering to
See you can help a bitch
let alone treat swell a bitch
'cause the bitch sold out...gon sell out...or the bitch gon snitch
Bitches wanna be and gonna always be around
Watchin what ya doin tryina use ya and keep ya down
bore ya with a story ya got ya own
Imma strengthn your conviction to give that dog a bone
And move on...for the motherfucker fakin you... fuck you
and make you take their punk bitch ass to the bank foo
see bitches get paid. these bitches got charms
I see em at the mall, on tv and on my homies arms
Just some of homies got bitches but we breaking bitches
so i come like dis bitch ""act like you know me
*Chorus*
Eazy E the muthafuckin manipulator when it comes to pussy, hoes
just watch how my dick grows
but since all hoes fall in the bitch category,
trustin no hooker ass bitch is mandatory
how much do you want? bitch how much can you take
'cause a nigga like the E you cant break
Put ya skinny little ass in my face and I'll slap it
Whip out my dick and let you lick before i tap it
My left hands on your ass my right hands on your head
'cause bitches get the nut.... and niggas get the lead
suckin my dick lickin my balls you know you are the master
suckin my toes lickin my ass you make me come faster
But it just dont stop
suckin everybodies dick...'cause its good to the last drop
but that shit dont faze me
I trust no car wrecking ho's this ones for you tracy
*Chorus*
Bitches aint nuffin but a hole in a 9 deuce
I'd rather make a mil while sippin a cold brew
Bitches aint shit...word to the digi-digi-dick
Eazy E PPC AMG and Quik
Bitch I aint babyface so save ya whip appeal
I neva go on dates with broke bitches, 'cause free meals
are suppose to pay the way to lucrative panty deals?
Bitch please, you betta hit ya knees
and you can even touch ya toes
'cause im still playin yall punk hoes like dominios
and if you suck the dick right and the pussy tight
I might not beat you down til the 2nd nite
Once a dog always a dog, trick
ya little trick tramp slut with a big butt
'cause you aint shit bitch
I'd rather fuck ya then love ya
'cause bitch I neva trust ya

258,boyz-n-the-hood-g-mix,2007,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Hey yo man, remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit"

Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game as how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP-12 now you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin real tight
Somethin to roll to somethin to stroll to
use a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo
A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till these women get the notion that they runnin the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then
Fillmoe, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club every one you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
press play on the remote at the playaz club
(chorus)
(more champagne, Mr. Forte?)
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
Words get now 4-Tay's out rappable
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin my paper chase
Cuz the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin 4-Tay I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin off them suckas poppin off the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin at these women at the playaz club
(chorus)
You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
Lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin in the wrong direction
Miss goody two sure see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin but a playa hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club
(chorus)
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the playaz club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club

Yeah I'd like to send this shout out
to all the playaz club throughout the world

But yet in every verse claim ya used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness to ya fuckin' work
See ya never had no business so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangsters
See I did dirt but put in work and many niggas can vouch that
So since I've got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of so many niggas
Claiming that they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets G
Think ya started trying to bang a rap
While ya tryin' to sign a peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mime while you rhyme
Little fag try to sag, but ya floodin' at the same time

hit a bitch wit a whip and she run like Toby
so never count on me fool when in the true skool
wit truce sluts lookin' for a crew screw
I flip and I flow when they go kinda low
hoe better have my dough so suck silly
hookers could stay or ya don't touch nuts
really hook a good day
adios disapear like a smoke your rejected
by a dick that's erect bitch
sometimes I think I'm losin' it a lunatic
with a lot of automatic shit with clips
it ain't no thang to me it's the same ole slang

throwin' harder with Barbara
seein' sexy with Betsy, gettin' ready for Betty,

Verse One:
It's that man comin up from that land of tha see-P-T
(""What's my motherfuckin name?"" - Snoop) Eazy-E
Comin through with a big lick for '94
Showin alla y'all them true-ass gangsta flows
So bow-wow bow-wow the big dog's in town
and them guts is the only thing a nigga pound
Laid back as I blow a fat sack
Hittin switches for them bitches, hittin corners in a Cadillac
So take a ride on tha ruthless side
with the E to the A-Z-why
That nigga makin more off yo hits than you do
you fools, need to recognize this crew when I roll through
Tryin to speak up on tha OG, nigga you don't know me
Break em off these nuts lil want to-be
Cause I peel caps if need be
And ain't nothin you gonna bring don't see me
Just tah let you know...
Chorus: repeat 2X
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin from the see-O-M-P-T-O-N
Just tah let you know
Just tah let you know
Verse Two:
It's the E comin up from the gank
so nigga let me ride all the way to the bank
Coz ain't nuthin on my mind but the gips
Gotta have a grip, run a nigga dip
Back to the pass on the Compton streetz
Where the niggaz get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin mad coz they can't ride like I ride
Front n back, dippin side to side
And it's been like that since I was a BG
""It's the E,"" that's what they scream when they see me
Mama said every day is like this
Fools screamin that I put em in a twist
Thought you had it bad, isn't really all good
If the homies only knew in the hood
That you was gettin done like a two dollar hoe
It's just a lil something from the E tah let you know...
Chorus
Verse Three:
It's still the see-P-T, nuthin more, nuthin less
On a quest to put that bomb in my chest
Coz them busta-ass niggaz can't see what I'm sayin
They think the E be playin [What ?]
But I ain't givin up nuthin but this glock in yo mouth
So recognize that and get yo punk ass knocked out
So if you want to ride nigga jump on in
Sip a cup o' gin. Ain't no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggaz be dealin
with the original Compton criminal
Coz the only thing poppin is a snaps
and ain't no fun when a nigga be tap perhaps
but a nigga like the E ain't trippin though
I'm just here tah let you niggaz know...

Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit"

Body slammn bitches makes Dre a bigger man.
Cackies sportin loc's in a G ride
What set you from loc what set you from ride?
Rip Vanwinkle sleepin nigga woke up and became a G
But you still don't impress tha E-Z.
Smoke a little sherm now you call that shit the chronic
Niggas on the West side call it bionic

And Niggas from the CPT ain't down with D-are-E
But ya gave it up,

Let 'em play ya jam shake ya hand and then they shoot ya
You can fool the people on the east coast an the mid-west
But In LA you still can't pass the test
See I can tell a pussy when I see one

284,black-nigga-killa,2006,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"(Chorus X4)
YEAH!
Black niggaaaaaaaaaa
YEAH!
Killa killa killa killa
Black nigga killa hate brought death
Around the block as I holler points bust though the punks back
Raising gang, feel no pain, as I penetrate
Niggas fly deep as I strike a quick pace
I got the evil of a dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to my mankind
Born to kill I'm wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breath young hell razors
I'm 30 odd 6 with the skill
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat
As I bring anger
And release more danger from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow and puts led in that nigga's flesh
Ain't no hope, every nigga wants to be the nine milla on the trigga
The black nigga killa
(Chorus X4)
Deep from the death as I crept
I can feel his glock in the back of my neck
I'm thinkin to myself what the fuck as I pause
I can feel my heart thumpin from my balls
Up against his gun what the fuck could I do?
If I make a wrong move, the nigga might shoot
My pops always warned me when I was comin up
If I play pussy, I'm bound to get fucked
Though bein broke as hell it be drivin me crazy
Hooked up with my niggas start jackin niggas daily
Fat sacks of dirt, to Dayton's, I got em
Slang em dirt cheap cause everything was profit
Now I got his nine on the back of my mind
As I watch my life pass right before my eyes
The shit that I done, is all in my face
Reflections of death as I step with my 38
The black nigga killa
(Chorus X4)
Which bitch made the statement?
About the nigga bustin caps supportin all black Ben Davis
I'm out the doe
My pager's blowin up I check my ghat twice
Cause niggas like to jack on a late night
And as I'm livin like a criminal
I try my best to keep my gang tight and stay away from punk niggas
Strikin down Broadway
I caught some niggas out of bounds from the (pause) upper MLK
Slowly crept from the cut at a quick pace
Ain't no love in my heart all I feel is hate
So 25 with that L might be mando
Cause nigga I'm killin for them gold things with that Zapco
I watch the terror in eyes as he backed up
Ease of the break pop that clutch and watch his chest bust
Wide open as I bounce in the night quicker
From the nine milla trigga
The black nigga killa
(Chorus X10)"

Referred to as a walking thief,

Why the fuck they blamin' him,
He's the one that they jock.
Keepin' niggaz in line,
Whoever fucks with his rhyme,
And before you fuck with him,
You gotta fuck with his nine.
Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga,
(A nigga)He could whoop his ass cause he's bigger.
Size don't mean shit,
He's from the old school fool,
He's a villain from the streets,
And he's supposed to rule,
Not sayin' he's in shit,
But he's down for mine,
He was put on the streets to keep niggaz in line.
Never givin' a fuck,

Got the trophys in the house,
For the girls that he laid.

Now of course he's the boss,

The boy got heart,
Wanna fuck with him,
He'll Rip your head apart.

But him with his gangsta stroll,
He keeps bailin'.

There's no discussion but silence.

Why dont you come out from the piano
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick, at about noon
Jus' thought that I had to be in compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about ma friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the path throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house, and grabbed ma clip
Wit the mack 10 on the side of ma hip
Bailed outside and pointed ma weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on ma ride
I got front back, and side to side
Then I let the alpine play (play)
Pumpin' new shit by nwa
It was gangsta gangsta at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit and it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo''
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold, shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be
A fresh el camino rollin' kilo g
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that g.t.a.
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull ya card
Knowin' nutin' in life but to be legit'

'Till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal the alpine
Chased him down the street to call a truce
The silly muthafucka pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 guage
One sucker dead, l.a. times front page

So I went to a spot where ma homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' dat dollar
I pulled up in ma 6 fo' impala
They greet me wit a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8 ball, my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get ma girl to rock that body
Before I left, I hit the bac-ardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old-ass out

Then wrapped the 6 fo' round a telephone pole
I looked at ma car and I said ""oh brother""
I'll throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home and I seen the g ride
Now cat is drivin', kilo on the side
As they busted a u, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked a pig in the head for rippin' his guess
Now g is caught, for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

Now I need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'cause I do a check, nut 1 nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it I'm still talkin' shit
I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy, that's my boy, godamnit

It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's sharon and the other one shaun
I want to nut but which one do I want?
Shaun said eazy let me fuck you blind
And sharon said e I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the
Other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
Here's what I'm gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit, grab it let's work it
But I won't love you when I'm done I'd still be talkin' shit ...
That boy'z good
Yeah that boy's good
That mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
You're mothafuckin' lyin'
How you know I'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
You're lyin', your dick can't get hard ..
Oh, suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied

Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut that shit
Hey yo yella boy! wantcha rewind it!
Niggas don't see I'm a 100% legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by eazy""
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
Oi might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of ya'll can just suck my dick
You can quote me now cause I'm still talkin' shit
The boy's good, I told you the boy's good
The nigga has talent
You don't know a damn thing
Yeah, I like that part, bring that shit back one more time, maestro

Aw shit, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff to this and don't step
On a funky-ass track jump back
Strapped with a gat and a sack and a 7-8 flak
Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
I hang with OG niggas don't set trip
Or you might get a slug in your fuckin back
I don't slack when it come to street
I kick real g shit to a gangsta beat
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a cool-ass tilt and a fly-ass Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, nad that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin love to them niggas that I know is real g's

If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool)
If you got love for them hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo if you makin straight dough (hooooo!)
If you got love for them playas

Dump dump on a nigga with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (who's that?)
A real nigga named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk niggas payin me
And broke groupie-ass bitches don't faze me
I take two step back and release myself
To put platinum-ass cuts on the record shelf
I don't brag, but i tell it like it straight-up is
Before you do a record, nigga, handle your business
And don't get caught slippin on the under
Or you might wonder (what's up with them ends, nigga?)
I call a spade a spade and get paid
G's show the way, so i give love to 'em
(Chorus)
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool)

Straight to the dirt, fool I do work
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
That's how it is when it come to me
Cause I'm the long dick bust-a-nut nigga named Eazy
Bitches can't see me, hos say I'm crazy
But I don't think so, cause I'm just loco

I don't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is, but I gives love to ya
